## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **`coverage-lowering` was blind to `package.json`.** Configs are parsed as TypeScript,
  where a top-level `{…}` is a *block statement* rather than an object literal — so no
  property nodes were produced and the file read as "no coverage gate here". Jest's
  `coverageThreshold` lives in `package.json` at least as often as in `jest.config.js`,
  and `**/package.json` has always been in the default protected config globs, so this
  was a silent false negative on a headline rule. **Anyone on 1.0.0 has a gate that
  misses coverage tampering in that file.** JSONC configs are now read too.
- Every git probe that missed — reading `.tamperward.yml` from a merge base that has
  none, which is the ordinary case — printed git's own `fatal:` line to the terminal
  before the caller handled the absence cleanly. stderr is piped now and folded into the
  thrown error, so a real failure stays exactly as diagnosable.

### Added

- **The verdict is rendered for whoever is reading it.** Under GitHub Actions
  (auto-detected), each finding becomes a workflow annotation placed **inline on the diff
  in Files changed**, plus a job-summary table on the run page — the verdict no longer
  lives only inside a collapsed job log. Annotations rather than SARIF deliberately: they
  need no `security-events: write` and no Advanced Security, so they work on every
  repository.
- Terminal output groups blocking findings first, wraps to the terminal, and keeps
  `path:line` intact so terminals linkify it.
- `--format text | json | github | auto` to select explicitly. `--json` is unchanged and
  the keys it already emitted keep their exact shape; `summary` is additive.

### Accessibility

Severity is carried by the word (`BLOCK` / `warn`) in every format, never by colour or a
glyph alone, so the verdict reads the same piped, in a log, through a screen reader, and
for a reader who cannot distinguish the colours. A test asserts that stripping the ANSI
from the coloured output equals the mono output byte for byte. `NO_COLOR` and
`FORCE_COLOR` are honoured; colour is off whenever stdout is not a terminal. The job
summary is a real markdown table with a header row.

### Internal

- Publishing moved to npm trusted publishing (OIDC) with no stored token, verified end to
  end via the `1.1.0-rc.2` prerelease. CI runs on pull requests only.
- 211 tests, up from 158.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-26

First public release.

### The engine

- `Change` model shared by every enforcement point: a change is a command or a per-file
  diff, and the engine never knows which point produced it.
- Pure unified-diff parser — add / modify / delete / rename (as one change carrying
  `oldPath`) / rename+edit / binary, with per-line old/new numbers correct across hunks,
  and git's C-quoted non-ASCII paths decoded before glob matching.
- Git adapter for the range, staged and working-tree views, enriching `before`/`after`
  with full content so the AST detectors have something to parse.

### Detectors

Eight mechanical rules, all `block`: `test-deletion` (AST block-count, rename-out-of-glob,
shell mutation), `test-skip`, `ts-any-cast`, `lint-suppression`, `coverage-lowering`
(Jest and Vitest shapes, all four metrics), `ci-tampering` (including checks removed from
a multi-line `run:` block), `hook-tampering` (including a hook gutted in place), and
`no-verify`.

Two heuristic rules ship as `warn` and do not block: `assertion-weakening` and
`guard-removal`. They graduate only when their precision is measured against a negatives
corpus — see SPEC §7.A.

### Enforcement points

- Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook — denies before the change reaches disk, and **fails
  closed**: if the gate cannot evaluate, the change is denied rather than allowed.
- Claude Code `Stop` sweep — re-checks the turn's net diff against the commit the turn
  started at, so a mid-turn commit cannot launder a tamper past it.
- `tamperward check --staged` for pre-commit, `--diff <base>...<head>` for CI.

### Trust model

- Three-layer sign-off: the agent layer honours nothing it can author; the local ledger is
  fingerprint-bound and expiring; CI honours only an out-of-band approval.
- At the CI layer the governing policy is read from the **merge-base**, never the head, so
  a change cannot weaken the policy that decides its own verdict.
- `ignore` can never suppress the policy file itself, and protected globs merge additively
  with the baseline rather than replacing it.

### Measurement

- Bypass-to-fix conversion (SPEC §7.B) measured over 42 agent runs: 0 tampers reached
  green; of 20 runs where a block fired, 20 ended in an honest fix. See the README for the
  arms, the split by model, and the limits of the sample.
