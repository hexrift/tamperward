# Cast inventory — TamperWard production source (#383)

Every type assertion (`x as T`, `<T>x`) and non-null assertion (`x!`) in `src/` on
`main` before this change, counted on the TypeScript AST by
[`harness/fp-study/cast-inventory.mjs`](../harness/fp-study/cast-inventory.mjs), with its
classification and what replaced it. `as const` is a literal-type request and is not
counted. There were **no** `as any` casts and **no** `as unknown as T` double casts.

| form | main | now |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `as T` / `<T>x` (ordinary type assertion) | 60 | 0 |
| `x!` (non-null assertion) | 14 | 0 |
| `as any` | 0 | 0 |
| `as unknown as T` | 0 | 0 |

## Classes

- **untrusted JSON** — a document that same-UID, candidate or third-party code can write
  (snapshots, telemetry, the ledger, hook payloads, package.json, Docker inspect output,
  the policy file). Replaced by readers that check every field before building the typed
  value (`src/narrow.ts`, `ptreeFrom`, `fsEventFrom`, `ledgerEntryFrom`, `readWatcherHealth`,
  `hooksOf`, `validate()`).
- **thrown error / process result** — `e as NodeJS.ErrnoException`, `e as Error & { stderr }`.
  Replaced by `errnoCode`, `errorMessage`, `execFailure`.
- **guard narrows** — the code had already checked the value; the cast re-asserted what a
  type predicate, an `in` check or a restructured condition proves.
- **literal / const list** — `(LIST as readonly string[]).includes(x)`. Replaced by `.some`.
- **non-null invariant** — `x!` standing for a fact the control flow can state.
- **TypeScript internal API** — `parseDiagnostics` and `text` are not on the public node
  types; `'prop' in node` narrows without asserting the whole node.

Security-sensitive paths (trust boundaries: policy, ledger, hook payload, envelope, verifier,
telemetry, git, dependency attestation) are marked **●**.

## Remaining assertions

None in `src/`. The one place a cast would have been the only way to reach a value —
TypeScript's non-public `parseDiagnostics` — is read through an `in` check instead.
Test files keep their assertions: they are fixtures, not the surface that decides whether
production typechecks, and `ts-cast-growth` excludes them for the same reason.

## Keeping it that way

`ts-cast-growth` (warn) reports net growth of this surface on every change; the
repository's own policy enables it. The inventory script can be re-run at any time:

```sh
node harness/fp-study/cast-inventory.mjs src
```
