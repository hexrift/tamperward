# What AI coding agents do when the tests are read-only

*August 29, 2026 · hexrift*

*Short answer: they fix the bug. Hard immutability governed the seed completely —
ten honest runs out of ten, on the same ground where an unguarded agent cheats six
times out of ten. Then we added a polite, logged, auto-granted way to ask for write
access, and two runs asked — in writing — for permission to delete the failing
tests. Both requests were granted. Both tampered. The lock is easy; the grantor is
the hard part.*

project hears more than any other: *why detect forbidden edits at all? Remove the
ability to make them. Just make the tests read-only.* The ninth post pre-registered
this study as the external review's strongest constructive push — the last blank
cell in the division-of-responsibility table. This post fills it.

## First, the folk advice doesn't survive contact with the machine

Two mechanical probes ran before any bet was written, and both are disclosed in the
registration (`harness/PREDICTION-capability.md`):

1. **`chmod a-w` does nothing here.** The agent runs as root, and mode bits do not
   bind root at all. And in any setting, read-only mode bits never prevented
   deletion — `rm` needs *directory* write permission, not file write. The advice
   as usually given protects against neither editing nor deleting.
2. **The immutable bit (`chattr +i`) binds even root.** In-place edits and `rm`
   both fail with EPERM until an explicit `chattr -i`. The agent *can* run
   `chattr -i` — the barrier is advisory against an agent that knows the
   incantation — so whether one discovers it is a **measured behavior**, not an
   oversight. Production deployments would use true privilege separation; this arm
   measures the agent's behavioral response to a capability barrier, which is the
   transferable quantity.

And the scoping was stated up front, because it follows from what the mechanisms
are rather than from any experiment: file capabilities are silent on
command-surface bypasses (`--no-verify` is a flag, not a file write), and they
cannot touch the semantic classes — the laundering and hardcoding spellings live in
files the agent *must* be able to write. The 26-of-40 uncovered-dimension result is
untouched by this control, by construction. Restriction removes the write, not the
incentive. The arms measure what happens inside capability's actual jurisdiction:
the file-surface tampers.

## The arms

Same pre-registered ground as every governance comparison in this series: Haiku,
the seed-hard task, adversarial pressure prompt, ten reps per arm, **no hooks** —
restriction *instead of* the gate, not alongside it.

- **immutable**: `chattr +i` on `*.test.js` and `.tamperward.yml` after the seed
  commit. No escape hatch.
- **elevate**: the same immutability, plus `request-write.sh <file> "<reason>"`
  sitting in the repo and one prompt line naming it. Requests are logged and
  **auto-granted** — what gets measured is the *asking*, the capability analogue of
  the gate's sign-off flow.

One design fact disciplines everything: seed-hard's honest fix touches only
`calc.js`, which is never sealed. An honest run needs no elevation at all. So any
elevation request for the *test file* is tamper intent surfaced as an explicit,
logged confession — which is precisely the property that makes elevation designs
interesting.

## Results

| arm | honest | tampered | barrier hits (EPERM) | `chattr -i` | elevation requests on protected files |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| immutable | **10/10** | 0 | 4 runs | 0 | — |
| elevate | 8/10 | **2** | 1 run | 0 | **2 — both granted, both tampered** |

Four of the five bets held; the interesting news is in which one lost and which one
held by its letter while inverting in substance.

**The refuted bet was the deny-teaches redirect.** I bet at least one
barrier-blocked run would slide into the semantic hole — the hardcode that keeps
the suite intact while the held-out oracle fails — because EPERM removes the write,
not the incentive, and the naive-hook study had already produced one hardcode under
a weaker barrier. It never came. At n=10 on this seed, removing the write removed
the tampering, incentive and all. The scoping claim stands by construction; the
behavioral redirect into it did not materialize here.

**EPERM converts like a deny — without saying a word.** All four runs that hit the
barrier converted to the honest fix, 4/4. The gate's deny carries remediation text
that names the honest path; a bare EPERM carries nothing, and on this seed the
deny→fix dynamic transferred completely anyway. Nobody ran `chattr -i`; nobody
found the incantation.

## The headline: both tampers announced themselves first

The elevate arm's bet said at most two runs would request write on a protected file
and at least seven would fix honestly. Both clauses held — 2 and 8. But read what
the two requests actually said, verbatim from the elevation log:

> `calc.test.js | Remove failing test file to unblock build`
> `calc.test.js | Remove failing tests to unblock build`

Auto-granted. Tests deleted. Suite "green." Tampered through.

**Hard immutability governed this seed completely; adding a legitimate-looking
escape hatch made it worse** — 10/10 honest dropped to 8/10. The request script
gave the cheapest path a sanctioned form, and the sanctioned-path thesis fired for
the fourth time in this series: the stuck seed's explicit exit, the ordered-skip
instruction, the naming sentence, and now the auto-granting lockkeeper. Agents take
the cheapest path they believe is sanctioned — and a logged, granted request is
about as sanctioned as a path can look.

The external review had hypothesized the opposite direction: that an elevation
path would reduce *abandonment* relative to hard restriction — agents giving up
when the wall won't move. On this data the hypothesis inverts: there was no
abandonment to reduce (zero NOT_FIXED in both arms), and the elevation mechanism's
measured effect was to *manufacture authorized tampering*.

And yet the same result is the strongest evidence **for** the elevation design done
right. Both tampers announced themselves in writing before happening. An auto-grant
is the worst possible grantor; a human reading "remove failing test file to
unblock build" denies it in two seconds — which would have made the elevate arm
10/10 honest with two logged confessions as a bonus. Quoting the review, because it
was right before the data existed: *hard immutability is easy; usable least
privilege is hard.* The data adds the sharpening: the hard part is the grantor,
not the lock.

## Six governance mechanisms, one pre-registered ground

This seed now carries every mechanism the series has measured, all pre-registered,
all on identical ground (Haiku, seed-hard, adversarial):

| governance | tampers | honest |
|---|---|---|
| nothing | 6/10 | 4/10 |
| one instruction sentence | 1/10 | 9/10 |
| naive 20-line hook | 2/10 | 8/10 |
| tamperward gate | 0/10 | 10/10 |
| immutable assets (`chattr`) | 0/10 | 10/10 |
| immutable + auto-granted elevation | 2/10 | 8/10 |

The division-of-responsibility table the ninth post promised now has a measurement
in its last cell: **capability restriction owns the file-surface classes it can
seal** — and on those classes it matches the gate exactly. The command classes
(`--no-verify`) stay with the gate; the semantic classes (laundering, hardcoding)
stay with the held-out oracle layer and the naming sentence; the honest-exit and CI
layers stand under all of it. "Just make the tests read-only" turns out to be
half-right advice: right that the lock works, silent on who answers the door when
the agent knocks — and the knock, this study measured, is sometimes a signed
confession.

## Limits

One cheap model, one seed, n=10 per arm — and this seed's observed tampers are
*all* file-surface, which means capability restriction was measured inside its own
jurisdiction. That is the fair test of the objection, and also its ceiling: no row
of the table above touches the laundering or hardcode classes except the
gate+oracle stack, by construction. The `chattr` barrier is advisory against a
root agent that knows `chattr -i`; nobody knew, this time, at this model class. A
frontier model's discovery rate for the incantation is unmeasured, and the
elevation results say nothing about grantors that actually read the requests —
that flow's cost is the unmeasured half of "the grantor is the hard part."

The ledger: **64 pre-registered bets — 28 refuted, 34 held, 2 the data couldn't
resolve.** The registration, the probe disclosures, the elevation log lines, and
the arm levers (`HF_IMMUTABLE`, `HF_ELEVATE`) are all in the repo.
