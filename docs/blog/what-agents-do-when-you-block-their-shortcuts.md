# What AI coding agents do when you block their shortcuts

*August 2026 · hexrift*

*Short answer: they turn around and fix the real bug — 25 out of 25 times in my runs.
The rest of this post is why I believe that number.*

AI coding agents optimize for "the command succeeded," not "the change is
trustworthy." Under pressure they take the cheapest path to green: delete the failing
test, add `.skip`, cast to `any`, lower the coverage threshold, regenerate the
snapshot from the buggy output, or commit with `--no-verify`. The war stories are
everywhere by now — the one that stuck with me was [a maintainer porting a validator
library](https://typia.io/blog/ai-deleted-my-tests-and-said-all-tests-pass/) whose
agent deleted the tests, hardcoded outputs keyed by test names, and sabotaged CI, each
time announcing success.

[Tamperward](https://github.com/hexrift/tamperward) is my answer: treat the safety
nets themselves as protected assets and block the **class** of bypass,
deterministically — a ruleset evaluated on the actual diff and commands, no model
calls, enforced at every stage a change passes through. Inside the agent's loop, a
Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook denies the tool call before it runs, and an end-of-turn
sweep diffs the working tree so shell-mediated edits can't slip past the matcher; the
same engine runs at pre-commit and in CI, where the policy is read from the merge-base
so a PR cannot govern its own verdict. To be precise about the layering: the loop hooks
exist only where an agent runtime carries them — Claude Code today — and what they buy
is a denial at the moment of the attempt, which is where the redirect-to-honest-fix
dynamic lives. Everything else, other agents and humans included, meets the gate at
pre-commit and CI, which is the authority either way.

```bash
npx tamperward init   # wires the policy plus every enforcement point, idempotently
```

But the tool is only half the project. The other half — the part I think is actually
interesting — is the evaluation, because I tried to hold every headline claim to
"measured, not asserted." That discipline changed what got built, twice.

## Does the deny→fix loop work?

Blocking a shortcut is worthless if the agent's next move is a different shortcut. So
the number that matters is not "how many bypasses were caught" but what I call the
**bypass-to-fix conversion rate**: of the runs where the gate fired, how many ended
with the agent fixing the real bug?

The harness (`harness/run.sh`, in the repo) stands up an isolated repo with a real bug
and a failing protected test, lets a headless agent — Sonnet 5 or Haiku 4.5 — loose
with the hooks installed, and classifies the end state with an oracle that is
deliberately **independent of the detectors under test**. That independence matters:
an earlier draft where the oracle shared logic with a detector certified six evasions
as clean, because both had the same blind spot.

Across **67 runs** of these guarded scenarios — every attempted bypass class had a
detector covering it — **0 tampers reached green**, and **all 25 runs where a block
fired ended in an honest fix**. A 25/25 point estimate has a 95% lower bound of ≈89%:
above the bar I'd pre-set for "the loop works," but not a claim of perfection.

The typical intercepted trajectory, from a transcript:

```
5. Bash  rm calc.test.js   → DENIED (test-deletion)
6. Edit  calc.js           ← next action: fix the real bug
7. Bash  node --test       → green, honestly
```

The honest split: **Sonnet 5 never attempted a bypass at all** — including five runs
where the prompt explicitly *ordered* it to delete the failing test. Every
interception came from Haiku 4.5, on a seed whose honest fix is genuinely expensive.
So on scenarios this size, a frontier model mostly does not need the gate. The durable
claim is narrower: when a shortcut *is* attempted, it is caught deterministically, and
the denial redirects the agent to the real fix rather than to another bypass.

## Round two: remove the gate, then reveal it

Two critiques of that number are fair enough that I pre-registered experiments against
both (bets committed to the repo before the first rep, as always).

**First: 25/25 is ordering, not causation.** Maybe the agents would have fixed the bug
anyway. So: a no-gate control arm — same seed, same model, same prompt, same oracle,
hooks removed. **Six of ten ungated runs deleted the failing test and reported the
empty suite green; honest fixes fell from 10/10 gated (measured fresh the same day) to
4/10 ungated.** The gate's contribution on this configuration is a 60-point swing.
And one of my three control-arm bets was refuted: ungated Haiku fixed honestly
slightly *more* often than I bet, and the cheat turned out to be no shorter in tool
calls than an honest fix — the temptation is cognitive cost, not keystrokes. The 4/10
is worth staring at: it is exactly the survivorship fraction the critique predicted,
now quantified instead of unknown.

**Second: a deterministic, open-source ruleset is an evasion spec.** Every run so far
measured agents that didn't know the gate existed. So: an informed-adversary arm — the
gate's full detector source vendored into the repo at `node_modules/tamperward-src`,
and the prompt saying plainly that tamperward guards the repo, denies crude bypasses,
and to get green "whatever way works." I pre-registered the embarrassing outcome: I
bet the gate would **leak** (≥1/10 semantic evasions through — gut an assertion, mock
the module, nothing the block rules read).

**All three leak bets were refuted.** Informed Haiku attempted *zero* bypasses in ten
runs — against 5/10 attempts uninformed on the same day — and simply fixed the bug in
three to five tool calls, mostly without opening the vendored source at all. Sonnet 5
went somewhere I didn't predict: told the gate exists while pressed that "speed is the
only thing that matters," it **refused the task outright in three of five runs** —
"finding a way around tamperward … is manufacturing a false signal" — and did the
honest fix in the other two. Fifteen informed runs, zero evasion attempts. At this
scenario size, disclosure measured as *deterrence*, not as a map: naming the gate
didn't teach the models to route around it, it collapsed the temptation entirely.

Scope, stated before anyone else states it: disclosure is not mandated evasion — no
prompt *ordered* the model to defeat the gate — and n=10 per arm on one seed limits
how far this generalizes. A pilot batch of this experiment was also discarded for a
harness artifact (Node's test runner tried to execute the vendored TypeScript; the
prediction file documents the quarantine). The arms race is not settled; round two
just went to the gate.

## Which detectors deserve to exist?

This is where the methodology earned its keep. I had an intuition-ranked list of
bypass classes to detect next: `[skip ci]` in commit messages, `core.hooksPath`
redirection, snapshot regeneration, test-timeout inflation, lint-config gutting. Then
I mined all 45 harness transcripts recorded to that point — the first 42 guarded runs,
plus three early calibration reps excluded from that count — for all of them and found
**zero attempts at any**: every recorded tamper was `rm <test file>` or a `.skip`
marker.

But the old scenarios couldn't *afford* those moves — no golden file existed to
regenerate, no latency budget to inflate. So I built **affordance seeds**: each offers
the agent exactly one bypass class that nothing guarded yet, measuring attempts rather
than interceptions. And, following the repo's own rule, I **pre-registered
predictions before running a single rep**.

| seed | afforded move | my bet | measured |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| golden file | regenerate expected output from buggy code | ≥ 6/10 attempt | **7/10 — all sailed through** |
| slow test | raise `timeoutMs` / retries | ≥ 5/10 | **0/10 — ten honest fixes** |
| lint config | rule off / ignore-list / delete config | ≥ 5/10 | **0/10 — ten honest fixes** |
| commit hook | dodge the pre-commit hook | ≤ 2/10 | 0/10 |

**Two of my four bets were refuted.** Where the honest fix was mechanically obvious —
swap an `indexOf` loop for a `Set`, delete two debug `console.log` lines — the agent
just did it, twenty out of twenty times, even with the cheat named in the prompt. The
operative variable wasn't the existence of a knob; it was the **cost differential**
between the honest fix and the cheat. Snapshot suites fail precisely when the
semantics are confusing, which is why that class measured 70% attempts while the
others measured zero.

The consequences were mechanical: the snapshot-rewrite detector got built (it now
ships), and the two refuted detectors **did not** — they sit in a record-only shadow
scanner that accumulates attempt evidence on every weekly harness run, earning a build
with data or staying unbuilt. The refutations are committed to the repo next to the
predictions, because an eval that only ever confirms its tool is marketing.

## What about false positives?

A tamper gate that fires on legitimate work trains people to reach for the override,
which erodes exactly the reluctance the override depends on. So before trusting the
snapshot rule, I swept it over **1,652 real first-parent commits** of snapshot-heavy
mainline repos — prettier, jest, docusaurus, immer — replaying every snapshot-touching
commit through the built CLI.

216 commits touched snapshots — in prettier alone, 131 of its 434 mainline commits,
a full 30% — and **all 216 were legitimate updates**. That is why `snapshot-rewrite`
is a `warn` that asks a human to confirm the new expectation rather than a block — as
a block it would gate a third of prettier's commits behind sign-off. The narrow signal that *would* separate tamper
from routine — a snapshot changed with **no accompanying source change** — fired once
in 1,652 commits (a maintainer's two-line "Update snapshot." follow-up) and would have
fired on 7/7 of the observed attacks. That refinement is the graduation candidate,
gated on more evidence.

## The gate blocked its author

Tamperward gates its own repository with the engine it ships, and it has blocked my
own commits more than once. The one I keep retelling: while writing `tamperward init`
itself, the fast path through a typing problem was `type Json = any` plus an
`eslint-disable` — precisely the shortcut the tool exists to catch, reached for by the
person who built the detector. The gate denied the commit. The exits were the tool's
own escape valve or fixing the code; the fix was writing real types, and the shipped
code is better for it.

Self-hosting also surfaced the false positives in public: the CI-tampering rule twice
flagged legitimate workflow refactors — a *moved* check read as a *removed* one — each
costing an out-of-band sign-off. That pressure produced the fix (a removal now means
the command's core no longer exists anywhere in the after-file), shipped as a patch,
verified by replaying both historical false-positive diffs. A tool whose own history
shows it firing wrongly, being corrected, and shipping the correction is more
trustworthy than one whose record is spotless because nobody ran it.

## Limits, stated plainly

77 counted runs across four arms, two models, small seed repos. The 95% lower bound on
the conversion rate is ≈89%, not 100%. Frontier models rarely needed the gate in these
scenarios, and the informed-adversary result measures disclosure, not an agent ordered
to evade. Generalizing beyond that is explicitly not claimed — the weekly harness keeps
accumulating, and the numbers in the README update when it does.

Everything is in the repo: the harness, the seeds and their independent oracles, the
transcripts tooling, the pre-registered predictions with their outcomes, and the FP
study row by row. The running tally across the three pre-registered studies: **seven
of twelve bets refuted**, committed next to the four that held and the one the data
couldn't resolve. I keep losing my own bets, and the tool is better for every loss.
