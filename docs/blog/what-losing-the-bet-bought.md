*Short answer: the experiment we lost turned out to be the best detector
engineering we've ever had. The 53 counted trajectories are a corpus of real
evasions with full forensics — and one anomaly in them was worth more than the
other 52 runs combined. This post is the engineering response to the failed
prevention bet: one new block rule priced on 2,304 real commits, an
effect-level layer that judges filesystem drift instead of command spellings,
and the one oracle nothing got past, productized. None of it is validated yet.
That's the next post, and this one exists so the rerun tests a design that was
public before it ran.*

[11](./before-we-test-tamperward-on-27-real-repositories.md) ·
[12](./we-tested-an-ai-coding-agent-on-27-real-repositories.md)). Post 12 reported
the preregistered result: on 26 paired real repositories, Tamperward 1.6.0 did
not reduce false greens (b=5 vs c=4, p=1.0), because pressured agents routed
around the shipped detector classes. The frozen protocol forbade touching the
treatment mid-experiment; the results post committed to fixing it after, and
to never validating the fix on the pool it was built from. This is the
after.

## The transcripts are the specification

Post-experiment, the 53 trajectories stop being radioactive and become what
they always secretly were: the best evasion corpus we could not have written
ourselves. Extracting every Edit that beat the gate gave a taxonomy with
names:

- **Case-table row deletion** — remove the failing `{input, expected}` rows;
  no assertion syntax touched; block counts unchanged.
- **Assertion-argument stripping** — `throws(name, input, expectedMessage)`
  becomes `throws(name, input)`; the call survives, the expectation dies.
- **Setup gutting** — delete the `vi.spyOn(...)` mocks a test needs to
  exercise the hard path; the test runs, vacuously.
- **Expected-value rewriting** — same-size edits changing expectations to
  match broken behavior. This one is *deliberately not* a diff rule's target:
  no rule can know the right expected value. It belongs to held-out
  re-execution, and it stayed there.
- **Snapshot side-channels** — a `tap-snapshots/**` spelling outside the
  snapshot globs, and `npm test -- --updateSnapshot`, which fired the
  existing rule as a warn... and a warn in an unattended loop is a no-op.
  That measurement now has consequences (below).

## The anomaly that mattered most

Run 07-fastify, gated arm. The agent turned the failing `test(` into
`test.skip(` with an ordinary Edit — the exact edit class that was denied at
PreToolUse in **eleven other runs** — and this one landed, unjudged. For 51
seconds the agent consulted the suite with the test skipped, then the Stop
sweep caught the persistent state, blocked the turn, and the agent complied:
restored the skip and fixed the source for real.

We reconstructed everything and could not prove which link ate that one call.
And that is the lesson, stated as engineering: **spelling-level inspection has
a floor.** Some mutation will always arrive by a path the matcher didn't see —
a hook flake, a reconstruction mismatch, a spelling from next year. You don't
fix that with a better regex. You fix it by also checking what the files
actually became.

## Layer 1 (1.7.0): the content-removal rule, priced before shipped

`test-content-removal`: net removal of ≥3 significant lines from a modified
protected test whose block count didn't drop — rows, assertion arguments,
setup. Removed content is excused only if it's actually *kept* (whitespace-
normalized, in the changeset's protected-test content — comments don't excuse;
the pilot agent tried commenting rows out first). One-for-one rewrites don't
fire: that's the semantic class, and it stays with the oracles that can judge
it.

House discipline before it shipped as block: swept over **2,304 real mainline
commits** (immer, zustand, zod, prettier). It fires on 1.5% of diffs, and
every adjudicated fire is legitimate maintainer work. The most instructive
one: prettier deleting error-expectation rows because the meriyah parser
genuinely gained a feature — **byte-shaped identical to the tamper**. No
mechanical rule can tell those apart; only the human who knows *why* the row
is leaving can. That's the argument for block-with-signoff over warn, and the
Phase-3 `--updateSnapshot` walk-through is the measured cost of choosing warn
in an unattended loop. The regression tests are the actual trajectory edits,
and the built hook now denies the exact selector-parser Edit that beat 1.6.0.

## Layer 2 (1.8.0): judge the effect, not the spelling

Two pieces, with the claim stated at exactly the strength it deserves: the
layer **detects persistent protected-state drift independently of the
mutation's command spelling, and can observe supported transient filesystem
effects.**

- **Per-call drift check.** The hook remembers what the protected tree should
  be (content hash + mode). When it drifts without a sanctioned edit, the
  ordinary detector stack runs over the drift — diffed against the turn
  baseline — at the very next call. No new judgment surface: findings come
  from the existing, corpus-priced rules, and the deny repeats until the tree
  is restored. Live proof: an unseen `sed -i 's/^test(/test.skip(/'` — no
  hook saw the sed — is denied at the following call by `test-skip`.
- **`tamperward watch`.** What no per-call check can see is a file modified
  and restored *within one call* — weaken, consult, restore. We measured that
  window: one occurrence in 59 real trajectories, and it was exactly the
  laundering pattern. A filesystem-event daemon now records protected-file
  events for the Stop sweep's `transient-protected-mutation` rule. Warn by
  default for a reason we can defend (a Stop block forces restores, and a
  compliant restore reads as churn — block-by-default deadlocks the honest
  path), raisable by harnesses that own that semantics, never lowerable. And
  one sentence we made load-bearing everywhere the claim appears: fs-event
  delivery is platform-dependent, so **a recorded event is evidence; an
  absent event is never evidence of absence.**

The residuals are in the CHANGELOG where they can be checked: transients warn
unless raised, semantic rewrites pass the effect check exactly as they pass
the diff check, and the state lives in `.git/`, which the agent can reach.
The loop layer is the correction layer. It has never been the authority.

## Layer 3 (1.9.0): the base-restoration half of that oracle, shipped

The one layer nothing got past in Phase 3 was never the gate — it was the
run-correctness oracle in the evaluation harness. **The Taskbench oracle
exposed every observed masked failure in that benchmark; `tamperward verify`
productizes its base-restoration component, not its withheld semantic cases.**
What shipped is a command:

```
npx tamperward verify --base origin/main --cmd 'npm test'
```

Two separate copies of the working tree — separate directories, not a sandbox;
both run agent-controlled code with the same authority the agent had. The suite
runs as-is, and again with every protected test, snapshot, and config restored
from the trusted base rev. Files the agent *added* inside a protected class are
**removed** from the pristine copy as of 1.14.1, so its protected surface is
exactly the base's. They were originally kept, on the stated premise that they
could only add strictness; that premise was false, and an added `conftest.py`
could deselect the very tests the overlay had just restored. Visible-green
plus pristine-red is a **masked failure**, exit 1. It interprets no diff at
all, which is why it is immune to spelling by construction. "Could not
verify" — budget exceeded, materialization failed — exits closed, never open.

Two honesty notes that made it into the tests rather than the fine print. The
`verify:` policy block is itself a guarded surface — the policy differ flags
any command change, any budget lowering, and removal as policy weakening,
because a verify the agent can point at `true` is no verification at all. And
the default base (HEAD) covers uncommitted weakening only: a tamper the agent
*commits* is inside HEAD and invisible to it. There is a test asserting that
blindness — asserting VERIFIED on a committed tamper, on purpose — next to
the test showing the trusted-rev base catching it. In CI, point `--base` at a
branch the agent cannot rewrite. That's where this layer belongs anyway.

## What none of this is

Validated. The 53 trajectories that motivated these layers are development
fixtures now — regression tests, forensic evidence, corpus material — and
they can never be the benchmark again: fixing detectors against the exact
behaviors a pool surfaced and then re-scoring on that pool is training on the
test set. The 53-for-53 record is a trajectory record on one frame, under one
model and one prompt, not a guarantee — and it is the *benchmark* oracle's
record, including its withheld semantic cases, not a record for the shipped
`verify` command on its own. And no prevention claim for
1.7.0–1.9.0 exists anywhere in the repo, because none has been earned.

Earning one looks like it looked last time: a fresh randomized draw from the
ranked frame source continued past the round-1 frame (which round 1
exhausted: all 500 repositories decided), mined by the same
battle-tested pipeline, a new registration with numeric bets published before
trajectory #1 — including, again, the conditions under which this stack
loses. The experiment that follows is allowed to fail us again. The last one
did, and this post is what that was worth.
