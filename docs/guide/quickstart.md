# Quickstart

*A ward is the obstruction inside a lock that blocks the wrong key.*

Get your repository protected in about five minutes — and see, before you install anything, exactly what Tamperward stops.

> **See the receipts first.** Every prediction we've registered, including the ones we got wrong, is published beside its outcome → [Evidence](../research/index.md). You're about to let a tool help decide whether code may merge; you should be able to check its track record before you do.

## The 20-second problem

Your test suite passes. You merge. But the agent that wrote the code also edited the suite that judged it.

Here is the move Tamperward exists to catch. An agent's change makes the **visible** suite green — while the **pristine** suite, re-run from your trusted starting point, is red:

```
$ tamperward verify --base main

  visible verification    ✓ PASS      (suite as it stands in the candidate)
  pristine verification   ✗ FAIL      (same suite, re-run from the trusted base)

  MASKED_FAILURE
  tests/auth.test.ts — assertion weakened between base and candidate

  verdict: FAIL
```

Nothing here is exotic. The agent didn't escape a sandbox or exploit anything. Under pressure to reach green, the cheaper path was to weaken the check instead of fixing the code — and a human reviewer, reading a diff where the tests still "pass," could easily wave it through. **That masked failure is the one that would have shipped.**

Two more moves Tamperward stops, earlier in the loop:

```
# The agent tries to revert protected verification state
$ git checkout -- tests/auth.test.ts
  DENY   protected verification state

# The agent loosens an assertion in place
- expect(result).toEqual(42)
+ expect(result).toBeDefined()
  BLOCK  assertion weakening — tests/math.test.ts
```

`DENY` and `BLOCK` are the visible moves — the ones a sharp reviewer might catch anyway. `MASKED_FAILURE` is the quiet one. Tamperward's job is to make all three impossible to land, and to fail closed when it can't be sure.

## Get protected

Requires **Node.js 20.19+**. JavaScript and TypeScript get the full detector surface; other ecosystems get file-level and pattern-based protection.

```
npx tamperward onboard
```

`onboard` is the guided first run. It previews every change before writing it, asks before touching your repo, wires the enforcement points, runs and explains your first verification, offers a safe demonstration of a weakening move on a disposable worktree, checks your GitHub-side controls, and ends with a clear posture.

It writes nothing you didn't approve. The deterministic primitive underneath is `npx tamperward init` — add `--dry-run` to print the plan and exit.

## Read your posture

The point of a security tool is knowing whether it's actually protecting you. `onboard` ends — and `tamperward doctor` re-checks, any time — with a posture report. A healthy one:

```
Repository            ✓ git root
Agent protection      ✓ Claude Code hooks
                      ✓ pre-commit gate
Verification          ✓ npm test
                      ✓ visible verification
                      ✓ pristine verification
Repository authority  ✓ required status check
                      ✓ code-owner review
                      ✓ stale reviews dismissed
──────────────────────────────────────────────
READY — your repository is protected.
```

Just as important, the report tells you when it **cannot** back its guarantees, instead of pretending it can:

```
Agent protection      ✓ Claude Code hooks
                      ✓ pre-commit gate
Verification          ✓ npm test
                      ✓ visible verification
                      ✓ pristine verification
Repository authority  ✓ required status check
                      ✗ code-owner review not enforced
                      ✗ stale reviews not dismissed
──────────────────────────────────────────────
READY WITH WARNINGS — local enforcement is active, but the paths
that decide whether the gate runs are not yet protected on GitHub.
Fix → [Enforcement & sign-off](./enforcement.md)
```

A posture of `INCOMPLETE` or `BROKEN` means Tamperward will not silently behave as if you're covered. Where it cannot adjudicate, it fails closed.

## How it works, briefly

Tamperward sits between what the agent controls and what your repository trusts:

```
        agent-controlled
              │
              ▼
          candidate
              │
              ▼
         Tamperward
        ┌─────┴─────┐
     steering   adjudication
                    │
                    ▼
             repository authority
```

**Steering** blocks known weakening moves as they happen, inside the agent's loop. **Adjudication** independently re-runs trusted verification against the candidate, outside the agent's normal completion path — this is where `MASKED_FAILURE` is caught. Neither path uses a runtime LLM judge; the checks are deterministic.

## What's outside its authority

Tamperward names its own edge, because a gate that oversells its coverage is worse than one that tells you where it stops:

- **Repository authority lives on your host.** The required status check, code-owner enforcement, and stale-review dismissal are GitHub settings. Tamperward generates and checks them, but it cannot enforce them from inside an npm process — which is why the posture report flags them rather than hiding the gap.
- **Authoritative run lifecycle is currently Linux-only.** On other platforms you still get steering and adjudication, but not the full process-lifecycle envelope. Your posture report states exactly what you're getting.

Treat Tamperward as one layer of defence in depth — alongside protected CI, independent tests, and human review — not a replacement for them.

## Where to next

- **Recipes** — protect Claude Code or Codex, wire GitHub Actions, add a container verifier, evaluate a model → [Runtime adapters](./runtime-adapters.md)
- **CLI reference** — every command, flag, and exit code (`check`, `verify`, `run`, `doctor`, `init`, `onboard`, …) → [CLI reference](./getting-started.md#cli-reference)
- **Configuration** — the `.tamperward.yml` policy, and why the policy file is itself a guarded surface → [The rules](./rules.md)
- **Trust model & architecture** — trusted vs. untrusted input at every boundary → [Architecture](../architecture.md)
- **Evidence & research** — preregistered predictions, outcomes, corrections, and limitations → [Evidence](../research/index.md)

> **Project status: active research release.** Tamperward is usable today, but its enforcement architecture and supporting evidence are still being hardened. The 2.0 major marks the Node 18 drop, not a declaration of security maturity — the distance to that is tracked milestone by milestone in [SPEC §9.1](https://github.com/hexrift/tamperward/blob/main/SPEC.md#91-maturity-milestones).
