  tagline: AI coding agents optimize for "the command succeeded," not "the change is trustworthy." Tamperward blocks the class of shortcut they take to force checks green — measured, not asserted.

features:
  - title: Deterministic, no model calls
    details: A ruleset evaluated on the actual diff and commands. There is no LLM judge to persuade — a gate an agent can argue with is not a gate.
  - title: Enforced everywhere a change can be made
    details: Inside the agent's loop (a PreToolUse deny plus an end-of-turn sweep, holding under bypassPermissions), at pre-commit, and in CI — where the policy is read from the merge-base, so a PR cannot govern its own verdict.
  - title: Measured, not asserted
    details: Across 42 guarded harness runs, 0 tampers reached green and all 20 denials converted to honest fixes. Two of four pre-registered predictions were refuted — so those detectors were never built.
  - title: One command to wire it all
    details: npx tamperward init writes the policy and every enforcement point, idempotently, without overwriting anything you wrote.
