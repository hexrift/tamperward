# Production pilot protocol

SPEC §9.1 milestone M3 closes when a named pilot publishes, over a stated period, its
per-rule fire and false-positive counts, `verify` wall-clock against the bare suite, how
often the out-of-band sign-off was needed, and hook latency, linked from the research
index whether or not it flatters the gate. No pilot has run (#480). This page is the
pre-registered protocol one follows when it does, written before any pilot data exists,
in the same discipline the corpus studies use: the fields and the adjudication rule are
fixed first, the numbers are read afterwards.

## Opt-in

A pilot is a repository whose owner has agreed, in writing on the tracking issue, to run
TamperWard in the loop for a stated period and to have the aggregate below published
under the repository's name. Nothing is collected from anyone who has not opted in; the
local audit log is off unless `TAMPERWARD_AUDIT_LOG` is set, and `stats` reads only the
file it is pointed at.

The period, the TamperWard version range, the agent runtime(s), and the policy in effect
are recorded on the issue when the pilot starts. A pilot that changes any of them
mid-period reports two periods, not a blended one.

## What is collected

Hook findings use `audit-v1` events. From 2.44.0, verification and explicitly requested
bare-suite measurements use a separate `measurement-v1` sidecar. Both writers are
allowlist-only; the historical finding field set is:

| field | what it is | who writes it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id`, `timestamp`, `surface`, `agent`, `rule`, `severity`, `decision` | the finding, as a rule name and a verdict | every hook deny or warn |
| `session` | a one-way hash of the runtime session id | every hook event with a session |
| `hook_latency_ms` | whole milliseconds from the hook reading its input to the deny being written | the PreToolUse and Stop hooks, on every deny they record (2.40.0) |
| `verify_wall_clock_ms` | historical finding-attached timing | accepted for older pilot producers; new automatic timing uses the sidecar below |
| `bare_suite_wall_clock_ms` | wall-clock of the same suite with no TamperWard, the comparison for the row above | the same producer, measured on the same commit and machine |
| `oob_signoff` | whether an out-of-band sign-off (a CI label or a local allow) was needed to clear the finding | accepted for older pilot producers; new verify sign-off use is measured separately |

With `TAMPERWARD_AUDIT_LOG=auto`, each `verify` invocation, including one nested in an
envelope, records one measurement in `.git/tamperward/audit.jsonl.measurements`. A custom
audit path uses the same `.measurements` suffix. Nothing is written when audit is off.
The record contains only schema version, random id, UTC timestamp, `kind`, `outcome`,
whole monotonic `duration_ms`, an optional hashed `comparison`, and optional boolean
`oob_signoff`. The comparison binds head, candidate content/modes, command and machine;
it retains none of those raw values. Sign-off is recorded only when evaluated, never
as the approval token. Exceptions are incomplete; an early fail-closed verdict is
recorded with its actual outcome and no invented sign-off measurement.

Verify duration covers its lifecycle, materialization, suites and state reconciliation.
It is not the sum of rounded per-stage seconds. For the bare comparator, explicitly run
`TAMPERWARD_AUDIT_LOG=auto tamperward measure-suite --cmd 'npm test' --budget 300`
in the same checkout and machine, using the same suite command as verify. This executes
the command in the **live checkout**, without TamperWard verification/materialization;
its timing includes process supervision but excludes before/after fingerprint checks.
It may create normal suite outputs. Timeout, an unfinished process, or changed head or
candidate inputs makes the measurement incomplete (exit 2), not a passing comparator.
Ordinary suite failure exits 1. This command grants no verification or sign-off authority.

Pair only records with identical non-missing comparison hashes, controlled dependency
environments and a documented run order/cache policy. Unpaired percentiles are descriptive,
not an overhead ratio. No host fingerprint proves a controlled performance environment.
Local sidecars are mutable, non-authoritative evidence, with the same trust limit as
the finding log. Missing or incomplete samples must be disclosed. Existing pilot logs
without the sidecar remain valid inputs, and manual measurement must be identified.

## What is never collected

Prompts, tool command bodies, source or evidence text, filenames, absolute paths,
environment values, credentials and the raw session id. The writer cannot serialise them
and the reader (`parseAuditEvent`, the publisher's `audit-verify.mjs`) rejects any field
outside its published schema rather than redacting it. The dependency-free publisher
validator can also validate a sidecar against `schemas/measurement-v1.schema.json`;
the existing finding publisher does not automatically publish sidecars. A pilot that needs a file-level view
keeps it private and publishes only the aggregate.

## The aggregate that is published

The `tamperward stats --json` document over the period's events (`stats-v1`):

- `events`, `blocked`, `warnings`, `sessions`, and `by_rule` / `by_surface` counts;
- `latency.hook_latency_ms`, `latency.verify_wall_clock_ms` and
  `latency.bare_suite_wall_clock_ms`: nearest-rank p50, p95 and max with the sample count,
  or `null` where nothing was measured;
- `oob_signoffs`.

When a sidecar exists, `stats` also reports separate `measurements` counts for verify,
bare-suite, incomplete runs and actual sign-offs. Timing histograms include completed
sidecar measurements alongside historical finding-attached durations; incomplete runs
do not enter percentiles. Finding counts, sessions and first/last finding timestamps
exclude measurements. Duplicate sidecar ids are counted once per input file. No event
count measures all session exposure. Publish the comparison pairing and outcome counts
from the sidecar beside the aggregate, rather than presenting a red suite as a green run.

Beside it, for every rule that fired, the false-positive count under the rule below, with
the denominator (fires adjudicated) and the number left `unclear`.

## False-positive adjudication

The criterion is fixed before any fire is opened, per rule, as
[`harness/fp-study/ADJUDICATION-RULE.md`](https://github.com/hexrift/tamperward/blob/main/harness/fp-study/ADJUDICATION-RULE.md)
does for the corpus studies. For a pilot the question is the same one that file asks:
*would the block have wrongly stopped legitimate work?*

- **FP**: the agent's change was legitimate and the deny cost a human a sign-off or a
  rewrite. The rule's own negative examples in [the rules guide](../guide/rules.md) are the
  reference; a fire that matches one of them is FP without further argument.
- **TP**: the change weakened a protected check, whether or not the agent meant to. Intent
  is not adjudicated; a finding is a signal, not proof of intent, and the aggregate carries
  `interpretation: finding-is-not-proof-of-intent` for that reason.
- **unclear**: the adjudicator cannot tell from the diff alone. Counted and published as
  such, never folded into either side.

The adjudicator is independent of the detector: they read the diff and the rule's stated
negatives, never the detector's own output. Adjudication happens once, after the period
ends, and the verdicts are frozen with the aggregate.

## Publication

The aggregate, the per-rule adjudication counts, the period, the version range, the
runtime and the policy are published as a dated page under `docs/research/` and linked
from the [research index](./index.md), by a maintainer-merged pull request. Weak results
publish too: a pilot that shows a false-positive rate above a block rule's deployable
threshold, a `verify` overhead the team found unacceptable, or sign-offs on most denies
is the finding M3 asks for, and the gate's response is a measured change, never a
quieter report. A pilot that stops early reports the period it ran and why it stopped.

Nothing on this page is a result. When the first pilot publishes, its page links here and
this page gains a row naming it.
